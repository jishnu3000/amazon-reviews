This repository is the code for the Applied Text Analytics Group Coursework.

Techniques demonstrated:
- Text processing (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, normalization stopword removal)
- Unigram vs n-gram representation evaluation
- Vector space representation (binary, frequency, TF-IDF)
- Word embeddings (Word2Vec, Glove)
- Evaluate different classification models
- Modelling text as a sequence (LSTM Neural Networks, BERT Transformer)
- Topic Modelling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Non-Negative Matrix Factorization)
